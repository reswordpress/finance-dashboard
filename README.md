# Finance Dashboard
A WordPress plugin to manage invoices & receipts (only for the Dutch market). This plugin adds an invoice & receipt custom post type and creates a 'finance dashboard' with income per month, quarter and year. You can enter your company details and start adding invoices, simply print them as PDF and send them to your customers. Visiting the dashboard will show you how well your company is doing.
