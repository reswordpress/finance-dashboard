# Finance Dashboard
A WordPress plugin to manage invoices & receipts (only for the Dutch market). This plugin adds an invoice & receipt custom post type and creates a 'finance dashboard' with income per month, quarter and year. You can enter your company details and start adding invoices, simply print them as PDF and send them to your customers. Visiting the dashboard will show you how well your company is doing. 

## Templates ##
By default, 2 templates are added; One for the single invoice and one for the single receipt. You can add your own templates inside a template folder of your theme. Copy the template files from the plugin to your theme and start editing. Don't forget the print css, for the pdf generation.

*This is built for my girlfriend's company. Used the sprInvoice WordPress plugin as a starting point. Feel free to give it a try, but use at your own risk*
